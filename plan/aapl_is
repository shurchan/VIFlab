Design Finance Statement database
Basically, standardize all three finance statements fields

1. Use AAPL, LBTYA, WFC to identify all fields of income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement
2. Create 3 empty panda.dataframes to add all "potential" fields of income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement respectively
3. Import any company finance statements with real numbers to fill panda.df with numbers matched field name in above #2
4. Export panda.df to csv with standardized "fixed" fields of income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement
5. Export those fixed fields csv of finance statements to finance statement db with fixed schema
